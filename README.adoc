== JBoss Tools Developer Documentation

This repository contains documentation for building and developing JBoss Tools.

It is meant to replace the articles related to development at jboss.org wiki found at https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossTools

See link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[Contributing] for how to write/add to these docs.

In general it is to be a wiki all developers can push docs to, external contributors can do pull-requests or report issues
to get things clarified/documented better.

== Table of Contents


1. Setting up an environment
** base installation
** extra plugins for productivity
** target platform -- see #2 below
** import eclipse settings? (codestyle, templates, etc)
** ~/.m2/settings.xml
** All about Tycho / release notes / latest changes
** Old doc:  https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-devdoc/blob/master/setup_development_environment.md

2.  Setting up the target platform
** Importing TP file (letting eclipse fetch)
** Building Locally and pointing to folder
** include-sources ?
** mirror tp (with / without SDKs)
** set the tp in eclipse / how to switch tp in Eclipse / reload TP etc.
** Old doc: https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-devdoc/blob/master/building/target_platforms/target_platforms_for_consumers.md 

3.  Configuring Git Workflow

** Initialization
** how to setup git locally
** useful aliases for the ~/.gitconfig
** useful bash scripts or git configurations
** show git branch in bash prompt when in a git folder
[source,bash] 
----
# add to your .bashrc: 

# returns the branch name
__git_ps1 ()
{
  local b="$(git symbolic-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)";
  if [ -n "$b" ]; then
    printf " (%s)" "${b##refs/heads/}";
  fi
}
export PS1='[\u@\h \W] $(__git_ps1 "(%s)")$'

# this may also be required for your distro
PROMPT_COMMAND=__git_ps1
----

** Now when in a git folder, prompt will look as follows:

[source,bash] 
----
[rob@localhost jbosstools-server]  (master) $
----

** Sources
*** how to clone a repo to fetch sources
*** how to import projects into Eclipse  (SOME projects require building BEFORE they can be imported)
*** setting Maven nature in a project to ensure it's built w/ Maven/Tycho instead of PDE
*** how to add upstream repo to your own fork
** Submitting Patches (Contributors)
*** how to do patches (patch branches)
*** guidelines for submitting a pull request / patch  (has to be in sync with upstream branch and contain jira issue number)
** Accepting Patches (Maintainers)
*** how to merge a pull request correctly
*** Best practices
**** When to use Merge commits
**** When to Squash
**** how to keep you local git clean (deleting local patch branches after merging)
